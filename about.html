		<div id="about2">I studied graphic design and worked full time
			as a graphic designer in <br> the advertising sector.
			I developed an interest in other creative areas<br/>
			and took illustration and animation classes
			where i started to work on<br> my own projects
			and experiment with various techniques
			such as<br/> collage and photo manipulation.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			My objective as a graphic designer is to  
			deliver a complete piece of work<br> both in terms  
			of aesthetics and functionality. My development
			as a<br> professional as well as a creative person
			focuses on the enhancement<br/> of my personal 
			style by experimenting with new techniques
			and trends.

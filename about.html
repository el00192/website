		<div id="about2">I studied graphic design and worked full time<br>
			as a graphic designer in the advertising sector.<br><br>
			I developed an interest in other creative areas<br>
			and took illustration and animation classes<br>
			where i started to work on my own projects  <br>
			and experiment with various techniques such  <br>
			as collage and photo manipulation.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			My objective as a graphic designer is to deliver <br>  
			a complete piece of work both in terms of <br>  
			aesthetics and functionality. My development<br>
			as a professional as well as a creative person<br>
			focuses on the enhancement of my personal <br>
			style by experimenting with new techniques<br>
			and trends.

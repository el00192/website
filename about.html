			<p id="about2">I studied graphic design and worked full time <br/>
			as a graphic designer in the advertising sector.<br/>
			<br/>
			I developed an interest in other creative areas<br/>
			and took illustration and animation classes<br/>
			where i started to work on my own projects<br/>
			and experiment with various techniques<br/>
			such as collage and photo manipulation.<br/>
			<br/>
			My objective as a graphic designer is to  <br/>
			deliver a complete piece of work both in terms  <br/>
			of aesthetics and functionality. My development <br/>
			as a professional as well as a creative person <br/>
			focuses on the enhancement of my personal <br/>
			style by experimenting with new techniques <br/>
			and trends.<br/>
			<br/>
			I am currently based in London working as a <br/>
			freelance graphic designer.</p>
